        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagne, singular lasagna, Italian are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragu (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna Sheets</li>
            <li>Aubergine</li>
            <li>Olives</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Tomatao</li>
            <li>Zucchini</li>
            <li>White Sauce</li>
            <li>Red Sauce</li>
            <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to <em>eat!</em></strong></li>
        </ol>
